/* Geometry-core firmware.
 *
 * Boot: run a VPU self-test, then loop: wait for the game CPU's doorbell (the
 * message word is the address, in shared RAM, of a GDL display list), walk it
 * (transform + triangle setup via the VPU, N64 triangle commands to MRDP),
 * signal done.
 *
 * BRING-UP: heartbeat progress codes are written to the geom->game mailbox
 * message CSR (mailbox_geom_msg, a plain CSRStorage -- writing it without a
 * kick just updates the register, the game CPU can poll it any time). The
 * game CPU prints mailbox_geom_msg while it waits, so a hang shows exactly
 * which stage the geom core reached. Trap faults show as 0xFA17_xxxx (see
 * start.S).

 * main loop starts trusting it. Used to also matvec-check an identity
 * matrix through vpu_matvec()/vpu_load_matrix(), but that path (software
 * S15.16, geom_vecmath.c) is already exhaustively host-verified
 * (test/test_geom_fixed.c, 500k+ trials, plus the full Fase battery) and
 * vpu_matvec() had no other caller -- dropping it here let gc-sections
 * remove it (and the identity-matrix constant) entirely, real ROM-budget
 * bytes this firmware's 16KB scratchpad genuinely needed. The CFU's own
 * hardware path (geom_vpar.h, the parallel vertex-transform accelerator)
 * is the one actually worth a real bring-up self-test if that's ever
 * needed -- it's untested by geom_vecmath.c's host coverage since it talks
 * to real Vpu4DFixed.v hardware, not software. */

 * bytes of IEEE conversion code into the 16 KB ROM. The heartbeat keeps its
