 *
 *  - Completion comes from the gateware, per frame: MRDP counts a SYNC FULL
 *    (sync_count) only once everything drawn before it is in DRAM. A "writes
 *    idle" flag could not answer this -- with frame k+1's clears already
 *    queued, the write channel never goes quiet.
 *
 * Frame k renders into s_kbuf[k % NUM_FB], the buffer frame k-4 used. It may
 * only be cleared once that buffer is off the screen: a newer frame must have
 * been flipped to AND latched by the scan-out DMA, which picks the base up at

     * at ~34 fps the 256-frame heartbeat fires every ~7.5 s and stalls the
     * game CPU for ~0.4 s while it drains. So: accumulate the worst frame
